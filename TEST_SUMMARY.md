# IBPI React Report Generation Test Setup Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive test setup has been created for the IBPI React application's report generation functionality. The setup uses Vitest as the testing framework with React Testing Library for component testing.

## Key Features

### 1. Mock Data System
- Complete mock data for all report components
- Covers customer info, test results, scores, and interpretations
- Includes error scenarios for testing error handling

### 2. Service Testing
- Tests for `reportDataService` covering all methods
- Mock Supabase client to avoid real database calls
- Tests for edge cases and error scenarios

### 3. Component Testing
- Tests for the `IBPIReport` component
- Verifies rendering of all report sections
- Tests loading and error states

### 4. Integration Testing
- End-to-end report generation flow tests
- Performance testing
- Data validation tests

## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:run

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:report      # Report service tests
npm run test:components  # Component tests
npm run test:integration # Integration tests
```

## Test Results

### Working Tests ✅
1. **Component Tests** - IBPIReport component renders correctly
2. **Service Tests** - Report data service methods work with mocked data
3. **Integration Tests** - Complete report generation flow works

### Database Connection Tests ⚠️
The database connection tests fail in the test environment because they try to connect to the actual Supabase instance. This is expected behavior and these tests should be run separately when debugging database issues.

## Mock Data Available

The test setup includes comprehensive mock data for:

- **Customer Information**
  - Name: 홍길동
  - Age: 14
  - Gender: male
  - Test Type: youth

- **Test Scores**
  - Main scales (CO, CL, OB, GU, SD) with percentiles and T-scores
  - Sub-scales with complete scoring data

- **Interpretations**
  - Summary text
  - Strengths and recommendations
  - Detailed analysis by scale

## Configuration Issues to Address

### Environment Variables
The tests are configured to use hardcoded Supabase credentials. For production use:

1. Create a `.env.test` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_test_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_test_supabase_key
```

2. Update the test configuration to use test environment variables

### Database Connectivity
The database connection tests show that the Supabase instance may not be accessible from the test environment. This could be due to:
- Network restrictions
- CORS policies
- Authentication requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure test-specific environment variables
   - Set up a test database instance if needed

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for other report components (ProfileDiagram, ScoreTable, etc.)
   - Add tests for error boundary components
   - Add visual regression tests for report layouts

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions or similar to run tests automatically
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Set up test result notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"fetch failed" errors**
   - These occur in database connection tests
   - Normal when running without network access
   - Use mocked data for unit tests

2. **Module resolution errors**
   - Check import paths
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

3. **Component rendering errors**
   - Verify all required props are provided
   - Check for missing mock implementations

## Summary

The test setup provides a solid foundation for testing the report generation functionality. The mocking system allows tests to run without database dependencies, making them fast and reliable. The comprehensive mock data ensures all report scenarios can be tested effectively.
